Question 1: How did you manage to fetch the list and what tool did you use?
Ans: I made use of the fetch method to execute a get response. Other way would be to use axios to make the API call


Question 2: What steps would you take to future improve this?
Ans: Would use the axios package to make sure the the API call is made through it. Also define ENV variables to seperate DEV, STAGE and PROD endpoint urls
